<h3>PWA Characteristics</h3>

<p>
  Progressive web applications or PWAs are a type of application that bridges the gap between
  a normal web application run in a browser tab or window and a fully native application
  installed on a phone or other device.
</p>

<p>
  Function
</p>
<p>
  A progressive web app typically has an icon that can be added to a homescreen or desktop.
  When launched, it typically will maintain some or all functionality without an Internet connection.
  In this way it differs from a normal web app or web page. The PWA may also launch in fullscreen mode,
  without typical web browswer controls/taskbars and also may launch without showing on-screen mobile
  controls like a back button, home button, or menu button. A final goal of PWAs is to create a more responsive
  and fluid interface in comparison with a traditional web browswer.
</p>


<p>
  Caching
</p>
<p>
  To maintain offline functionality and improve responsiveness many PWAs will cache some
  or all of the content they're expected to present on launch. This can reduce or eliminate
  the amount of data the application needs to fetch from the host and will allow the user to
  still use the app without an internet connection. For example, an user of a messenging app
  will still want to be able to read their previous messages even if they don't have an
  internet connection at that moment, right?
</p>


<p>
  Notifications
</p>
<p>
  An useful feature present on many native apps is push notifications. Although websites
  did not always have the ability to send notifications to users, many now do. A PWA is also
  capable of mimicking this behavior and as such gains a lot of functionality/utility.
</p>


<p>
  Manifest
</p>
<p>
  The manifest is a feature of a web app that allows it differ in appearance from a normal webpage.
  Example, background_color is a property that changes the color fo the background of the splash
  screen, the screen that shows up on launch when the app is still loading. From here, the icon shows
  up on the homescreen can also be changed.

  //registers service worker - replaces a call to app.js file that would have roughly the same content
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    window.addEventListener('load', function() {
      navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js');
    });
  }
