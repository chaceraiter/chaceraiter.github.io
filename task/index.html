<h3>Hybrid Apps</h3>

<p>
  The following is a report on solutions that can be used to create a hybrid app.
  A hybrid app appears on the spectrum of applications between a fully native, mobile-first application and
  an application designed for use exclusively with a web browswer.

  A hybrid app's primary purpose is to reduce difficulty of development. Producing full-featured apps with their
  own languages and technologies for each platform adds many layers of complexity to the creation process.
  Producing a web app that can then be "wrapped" in a hybrid app greatly reduces this burden. At the same time,
  asking users to use your service by way of a web browswer and web app may not allow use of some phone's accessories
  and will not always be the most convenient solution. A hybrid app attempts to take the most important strengths from
  each of these columns.

  All that said, a decision needs to be made regarding the design and construction of our app and the technologies used
  to do so. In brief, I will discuss the pros and cons of different methods to facilitate making a process decision.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Phonegap/Cordova
</p>
<p>
  Phonegap, also known as Cordova, is one of the "wrappers" or technologies utilized to turn a web app into a capable
  native application for multiple platforms. It was something of a pioneer in hybrid app development. Like the other
  technologies mentioned here, Phonegap had the backing of a major company, Adobe. Unfortunately, as of 2020, Adobe is
  no longer developing or supporting Phonegap. One of the major interesting features of Phonegap was the ability to 
  develop a web app and then nearly automatically convert to a hybrid, mobile-capable app by providing your web app's 
  files to the service. As this is no longer supported it is not recommended for use.
</p>
<br>
  

<p>
  Flutter
</p>
<p>
  Flutter is another product used to develop applications for multiple platforms simultaneously. It's a Google product.
  Flutter is well-documented and allows the use of hot updates for speedy development. Its performance on the top end may
  be surpassed by other existing products. From a community standpoint, adoption is growing and there are a lot of other
  developers to leverage as support. That said, it is still not a product intended for developing native apps any
  product created with it will suffer the downsides inherit to non-native apps.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  React Native
</p>
<p>
  React Native is another framework that allows for development of apps. Like Flutter, its supported by a major company
  with other products (well funded), Facebook. Its similar to Flutter in many respects but differs in that it uses 3rd party
  packages for many functionalities. While this means you may find increased functionality due to the open source nature
  and development by 3rd parties, you can also find abandoned projects and tools that no longer work. Regarding native apps,
  React Native suffers the same downsides as Flutter.
